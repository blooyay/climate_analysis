# Climate Analysis Project

## About

In this project, we analyze climate and ecology data from several sources. The goal is to showcase machine learning methods like time series forecasting, correlation.

In this repository, we enable the synthesis of several different datasets and draw conclusions about causality, predict future values, assess environmental risks, and propose data-driven solutions for sustainability.

## Setup

Have `conda` installed.

`conda env create --name climate --file=env.yml`

Install the `climate_analysis` package.

`pip install -e .`


## How to run this code

The data comes from the following sources, but is included in `data/`:

#### Pollution data (CO2 ppm)
https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data#cc3

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Global Monitoring Laboratory.


#### Natural disaster count
https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data#cc3

#### Global surface temperature
https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data#cc3

#### Ocean ph levels
